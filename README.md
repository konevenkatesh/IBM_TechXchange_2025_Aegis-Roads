[cite_start]A submission for the **IBM TechXchange "Sustainable Cities" Hackathon**[cite: 3]. [cite_start]A.U.R.A. is a multi-agent AI system designed to create a "digital life-force" for a city, making complex urban data accessible and actionable through a Knowledge Graph and intelligent agents[cite: 7, 8, 101].

## üèôÔ∏è About the Project

[cite_start]The core concept is to build an AI Agentic Environment that allows users to easily access city information and generate reports on urban development and infrastructure progress[cite: 5]. [cite_start]The project is conceptualized around the **Amaravati Capital City project**, an ambitious plan for a new capital for the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh[cite: 10, 11].

[cite_start]A.U.R.A. transforms complex, siloed city data into a structured, interconnected Knowledge Graph, which can then be queried by a collaborative multi-agent system powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate[cite: 23, 24, 25, 26, 28].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture and Workflow

The system is built on a robust pipeline that converts raw geospatial data into an intelligent, queryable knowledge base.

### 1. Ontology & Knowledge Graph Creation
* [cite_start]**Ontology Schema**: The foundation is a custom ontology schema named **ADTO (Amaravati Digital Twin Ontology)** [cite: 34][cite_start], which formally defines the entities of a city (buildings, roads, pipes) and the relationships between them[cite: 30, 31].
* [cite_start]**Technology**: The schema was developed using the `rdflib` library in Python[cite: 33].

### 2. Data Ingestion & Transformation
* [cite_start]**Data Source**: The initial data is sourced from the official Amaravati master plan[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Extraction**: **QGIS**, an open-source GIS software, was used to extract map data into GeoJSON format [cite: 42][cite_start], focusing on the road network, water supply system, and official zoning for this demo[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Conversion**: A Python program ingests the GeoJSON data and maps it to the ADTO schema[cite: 45, 46], creating a semantically structured RDF graph. [cite_start]The final knowledge graph is saved in the **Turtle (.ttl)** format[cite: 48, 49].

### 3. Backend Infrastructure
* [cite_start]**Database Server**: **Apache Jena Fuseki** is used to host the knowledge graph[cite: 62]. [cite_start]It provides a **SPARQL endpoint**, which allows the AI agents to query the graph directly using the SPARQL language[cite: 63, 64].
* [cite_start]**API Server**: A **FastAPI** server acts as an intelligent middle layer[cite: 67]. [cite_start]It simplifies queries by providing clean APIs for the agents and is capable of performing advanced GeoAnalytics on the data retrieved from the graph[cite: 69, 70].

### 4. AI Agentic Environment
* [cite_start]**Platform**: The entire agentic system is built using the **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK (Application Development Kit)**[cite: 74]. [cite_start]The ADK allows for the creation of agents and tools based on a standard OpenAPI specification[cite: 75].
* [cite_start]**Multi-Agent System**: A.U.R.A. is not a single agent but a collaborative system where different agents perform specialized tasks[cite: 86, 87]. [cite_start]A key component is the `Knowledge_graph_service_agent`, which acts as an expert on the database structure, helping other agents generate accurate SPARQL queries[cite: 93, 94, 96].

### 5. User Interface
* [cite_start]**WhatsApp Integration**: Instead of a traditional chat platform, the A.U.R.A. agent is connected directly to **WhatsApp**[cite: 82]. [cite_start]This allows citizens and city planners to interact with the powerful backend simply by sending a message[cite: 83].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **AI Platform**: IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Knowledge Graph**: RDFlib, Apache Jena Fuseki, SPARQL
* **API Framework**: FastAPI
* **GIS**: QGIS
* **Data Formats**: GeoJSON, Turtle (.ttl), OpenAPI Specification

## üöÄ Future Scope

[cite_start]While this demo focuses on road networks, water supply, and zoning, the system is designed to be scalable[cite: 89]. Future work can include:
* Ingesting more diverse datasets (e.g., real-time sensor data, public transport schedules, energy consumption).
* Enhancing the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) capabilities for more natural and complex user queries.
* Developing more specialized agents for different urban domains like traffic management, disaster response, and energy distribution.
