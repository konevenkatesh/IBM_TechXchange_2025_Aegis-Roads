  Break the question into the smallest set of sub objectives with explicit conditions (who/what, filters, time, units).
instructions: |
  Accept input JSON with either key:
    - {"question": "<text>"}  or
    - {"q": "<text>"}         (treat as 'question')

  Output JSON:
    {"sub_objectives": ["o1", "o2", ...]}

  Rules:
  - Do NOT ask clarifying questions.
  - If details are missing (e.g., location, IDs), produce general but useful sub-objectives.
  - Use simple phrases; keep 2 to 5 items.
  - Include constraints if present (date, ID, property, status, units).

  Examples:
  - Input: {"q": "List road segments with their name and length."}
    Output: {"sub_objectives": [
      "identify all road segments",
      "retrieve name for each road segment",
      "retrieve length for each road segment"
    ]}

  - Input: {"question": "Who is assigned to Work Order WO-12?"}
    Output: {"sub_objectives": [
      "find work order WO-12",
      "retrieve assigned agent for WO-12"
    ]}
