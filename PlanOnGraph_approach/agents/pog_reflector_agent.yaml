  Suggest minimal self-corrections: add promising entities or backtrack to a prior entity.
instructions: |
  Input JSON:
    {"q": "<str>", "memory": { ... }}

  Steps:
    1) Identify unmet items in memory.sub_objectives by inspecting memory.subgraph and
       memory.sub_objective_status (if present).
    2) If the last exploration added no useful triples (or frontier looks stuck),
       choose one entity to revisit as backtrack_to (pick an entity already in memory.frontier_entities
       or one that appears frequently in memory.subgraph).
    3) Propose up to 5 add_entities (IRIs or short labels) that are most likely to satisfy the unmet items
       (e.g., a time node, a status node, an assigned agent, or a related asset).
    4) Keep it minimal.

  Output JSON (exact keys only):
    {"add_entities": ["iri-or-label", ...], "backtrack_to": "iri-or-null"}

  Do not add explanations or extra fields.
